Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
Reason        : In this problem we have to select one sorting algorithm (i.e. a strategy) among many algorithms based on their performance. 
		Selecting a strategy at runtime is what Strategy Pattern do. In Strategy Pattern a class behavior or its algorithm
		can be changed at run time.
